    "Blocks": {
      "comparison": "The blocks in both CFGs are largely similar in terms of content and purpose. However, the LLM-based CFG tends to merge some statements into single blocks where the static-based CFG splits them. For example, the LLM CFG combines the import statement and function call into a single block, whereas the static CFG separates them.",

    "Edges / Successors": {
      "comparison": "The control-flow edges between blocks are consistent across both CFGs, with both agreeing on the branching after conditional statements and loops. No missing or extra edges were identified.",

    },
    "Additional Observations": {
      "comparison": "The LLM CFG includes line numbers, which are absent in the static CFG. This could be useful for debugging or more detailed analysis. The representation of special constructs like loops and conditionals is consistent between both CFGs.",

      "differences": "Presence of line numbers in LLM CFG."
    }
  },
  "summary": "The LLM-based CFG closely matches the static-based CFG across all analyzed dimensions, with minor differences in block structure and the inclusion of line numbers. The overall structure, function nesting, and control-flow edges are highly consistent, indicating a strong alignment between the two CFGs. The LLM CFG's accuracy relative to the static CFG is high, with an overall score of 85 out of 100.",
  "recommendations": "The LLM-based CFG is a reliable representation of the code's control flow, closely matching the static-based CFG. For tasks requiring detailed block-level analysis, consider the minor differences in block merging. The inclusion of line numbers in the LLM CFG could be beneficial for debugging or more granular analysis."
