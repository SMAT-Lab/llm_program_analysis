    "Classes and Functions Structure": {
      "comparison": "Both CFGs contain the same function 'binary_count_trailing_zeros' with no classes. The nesting and structure of the function are consistent across both CFGs.",
      "missing_or_extra": "No missing or extra classes/functions found."
    },
    "Blocks": {
      "comparison": "The blocks in both CFGs are mostly similar in terms of content and purpose. However, the LLM-based CFG splits the condition checks into separate blocks more distinctly than the static-based CFG, which merges some conditions into a single block.",
      "differences": "The static CFG combines the check for negative numbers and float type into a single block with multiple successors, whereas the LLM CFG separates these checks into distinct blocks."
    },
    "Edges / Successors": {
      "comparison": "The control-flow edges between blocks are largely consistent, with both CFGs correctly identifying the branching after condition checks. The LLM CFG introduces an 'elif' condition explicitly, which is implicitly handled in the static CFG.",
      "missing_or_extra": "No missing or extra edges found, but the LLM CFG's explicit 'elif' block adds clarity to the control flow."
    },
    "Additional Observations": {
      "observations": "The LLM CFG provides line numbers, which are absent in the static CFG, offering additional context. The handling of special constructs like condition checks is more explicit in the LLM CFG, potentially making it easier to understand for some users."
    }
  },
  "summary": "The LLM-based CFG closely matches the static-based CFG, with minor differences in block subdivision and the explicit use of 'elif' for condition checks. These differences do not significantly impact the overall accuracy or utility of the CFG. The LLM CFG's additional details, such as line numbers, enhance its clarity and usability. Overall, the LLM CFG is highly accurate and reliable for understanding the control flow of the provided Python code."
