  "summary": "The LLM CFG provides a high-level overview but lacks the detailed structure, block subdivisions, and control flow edges present in the static CFG. This results in a significant loss of detail and accuracy, particularly within function definitions. The LLM CFG could be improved by incorporating more detailed block structures and control flow information to better match the static CFG."
