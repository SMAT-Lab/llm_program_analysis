    "Classes and Functions Structure": {
      "comparison": "Both CFGs contain the same function 'sentry_init' with no classes. The structure and nesting of the function are consistent across both CFGs.",
      "missing_or_extra": "No missing or extra classes/functions found."
    },
    "Blocks": {
      "comparison": "The blocks in both CFGs are similar in content but differ slightly in their representation. The static CFG labels the block with a line number prefix (#1, #3), whereas the LLM CFG uses start_line and end_line attributes. The content of the blocks, especially the function definition and its body, is accurately represented in both.",
      "differences": "The main difference is in the labeling and the way blocks are subdivided. The static CFG uses a more granular approach with line numbers, while the LLM CFG groups the function definition and its body into a single block with a start and end line."
    },
    "Edges / Successors": {
      "comparison": "Both CFGs correctly represent the control flow with no successors for the given blocks, indicating a straightforward execution flow without branching.",
      "missing_or_extra": "No missing or extra edges found."
    },
    "Additional Observations": {
      "observations": "The LLM CFG effectively captures the essence of the static CFG, with minor differences in block representation. The use of start_line and end_line in the LLM CFG provides a clear indication of the block's scope, which is slightly more informative than the static CFG's line number prefix."
    }
  },
  "summary_and_recommendations": {
    "assessment": "The LLM-based CFG closely matches the static-based CFG across all analyzed dimensions. The main differences lie in the representation of blocks, which does not significantly impact the overall understanding of the control flow. The LLM CFG is highly accurate, with a minor room for improvement in aligning the block representation style with the static CFG.",
    "recommendations": "To further improve the LLM CFG's accuracy, consider adopting a more granular block labeling approach similar to the static CFG, especially for educational or detailed analysis purposes. However, for most practical applications, the current level of detail is sufficient."
