    "Classes and Functions Structure": {
      "comparison": "Both CFGs accurately represent the 'TextFormatter' class and its methods '__init__' and 'format_string'. The nesting of functions within the class is consistent across both CFGs.",
      "discrepancies": "None"
    },
    "Blocks": {
      "comparison": "The blocks in both CFGs are largely similar, with the same logical divisions and content. The LLM CFG includes line numbers and slightly more detailed labels, which adds clarity but does not affect the logical structure.",
      "discrepancies": "The LLM CFG's block labels are more detailed, including the function definitions and comments, whereas the static CFG's labels are more concise. This is a minor difference in presentation rather than structure."
    },
    "Edges / Successors": {
      "comparison": "Both CFGs correctly represent the control flow, with no missing or extra edges. The transitions between blocks are accurately depicted in both CFGs.",
      "discrepancies": "None"
    },
    "Additional Observations": {
      "comparison": "Both CFGs handle special constructs like method definitions and imports similarly. The LLM CFG provides additional context with line numbers and comments, which is beneficial for understanding but does not impact the control flow accuracy.",
      "discrepancies": "None"
    }
  },
  "summary": "The LLM-based CFG closely matches the static-based CFG across all analyzed dimensions. The main differences are in the presentation of block labels, with the LLM CFG offering more detailed descriptions. This does not affect the accuracy of the control flow representation. Overall, the LLM CFG is highly accurate, with a score of 95 out of 100, indicating a very close alignment with the static CFG."
