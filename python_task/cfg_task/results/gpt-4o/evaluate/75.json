  "summary": "The LLM-based CFG and the static-based CFG show a high level of similarity in terms of structure and edges, indicating that the LLM has accurately captured the overall flow and relationships between blocks. However, there is a notable discrepancy in how blocks are represented, particularly in the granularity and content of the blocks. The static CFG presents a more concise and focused block structure, while the LLM CFG includes a more detailed and verbose block, which may not be as efficient for analysis. Despite this, the core functionality and flow are accurately represented in both CFGs, suggesting that the LLM-based CFG is a reliable approximation of the static-based CFG, albeit with some differences in block representation.",
  "recommendations": "To improve the accuracy and utility of the LLM-based CFG, consider refining the block representation to more closely match the concise and focused structure of the static-based CFG. This could involve simplifying the block labels and content to highlight key statements and control flow points, rather than including extensive detail that may not be necessary for analysis. Additionally, further validation against a broader range of static CFGs could help identify and address any systematic discrepancies in block representation."
