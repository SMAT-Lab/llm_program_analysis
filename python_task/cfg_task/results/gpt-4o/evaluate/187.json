    "1. Classes and Functions Structure": {
      "Comparison": "Both CFGs have a 'main' function with no classes.",
      "Consistency": "The functions and classes are consistently nested.",
      "Missing/Extra": "No missing or extra functions/classes in either CFG."
    },
    "2. Blocks": {
      "Comparison": "The static CFG has blocks labeled with id #1 and #3, whereas the LLM CFG has blocks labeled with id #1 and #2.",
      "Subdivision": "LLM CFG splits the last import and 'if' statement into separate blocks, whereas static CFG combines them.",
      "Significant Differences": "LLM CFG does not have the block labeled #3 with function content."
    },
    "3. Edges / Successors": {
      "Comparison": "Both CFGs have an edge from the entry block to call 'main()'.",
      "Missing/Extra": "LLM CFG does not include the edge leading into the 'run_processes' call within the 'main()' function, as found in static CFG."
    },
    "4. Any Additional Observations": {
      "Unusual Constructs": "No unusual constructs were detected.",
      "Line Numbers": "Line numbers in the LLM CFG are more granular, aiding in source code mapping."
    },
    "5. Summary and Recommendations": {
      "Assessment": "The CFGs mostly match, although there are discrepancies in block formation and missing details in the LLM CFG.",
      "Accuracy": "LLM-based CFG captures the basic structure but misses the content of the 'main()' function.",
      "Score": "Overall, the LLM CFG alignment with the static CFG is moderate, with room for improvement in capturing function contents."
