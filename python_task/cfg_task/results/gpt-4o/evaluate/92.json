    "Blocks": {
      "comparison": "The blocks are mostly similar, with the LLM-based CFG providing more detailed line number information. The main difference is in the labeling of the blocks, where the LLM-based CFG includes the entire function definition in the first block's label, whereas the static-based CFG splits this into a docstring and the function's logic. This does not affect the logical structure but is a difference in representation.",

    "Edges / Successors": {
      "comparison": "The control-flow edges between blocks are identical in both CFGs. Both correctly represent the branching after the 'if' statement within the 'binary_xor' function.",
      "match": true
    },
    "Additional Observations": {
      "comparison": "The LLM-based CFG includes start and end line numbers for each block, providing more detailed information than the static-based CFG. This additional detail does not impact the logical accuracy but offers more context for understanding the code's structure.",
      "match": true
    }
  },
  "summary": "The LLM-based CFG closely matches the static-based CFG across all analyzed dimensions. The main differences are in the representation of block labels and the inclusion of line numbers in the LLM-based CFG, which do not affect the logical structure or accuracy. The LLM-based CFG is highly accurate, with a score of 95 out of 100, indicating a very close alignment with the static-based CFG."
