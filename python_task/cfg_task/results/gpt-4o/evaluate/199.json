    "Classes and Functions Structure": {
      "Comparison": "Both CFGs contain the function 'get_index_of_rightmost_set_bit' and have a similar top-level structure. No classes are present in either CFG. The function is not nested within any class in both CFGs.",
      "Missing/Extra Elements": "No missing or extra classes/functions as both match perfectly."
    },
    "Blocks": {
      "Block Comparison": "The blocks closely match in terms of content and boundaries. The LLM CFG includes additional 'start_line' and 'end_line' metadata that isn't present in the static CFG. The substantive labels match well, with minor differences in comments or non-executable content.",
      "Subdivision": "Both CFGs generally subdivide blocks similarly, with the primary difference being the inclusion of line numbers in the LLM CFG."
    },
    "Edges / Successors": {
      "Edge Comparison": "Basic block transitions are consistent for the most part. However, a significant difference is seen in the 'while intermediate:' loop label; the LLM CFG introduces an empty label block which might not affect execution but impacts representation.",
      "Missing/Extra Edges": "No edges are missing, but there's an extra backward edge present in the LLM CFG representation within the loop due to block labeling inconsistencies."
    },
    "Additional Observations": {
      "Special Constructs": "The handling of the try-except block is consistent between the two CFGs.",
      "Line Numbers": "Significant differences arise due to the inclusion of line numbers in the LLM CFG, which may not be as relevant to logical alignment but affects structural properties."
    }
  },
  "Summary and Recommendations": "The LLM-based CFG is largely accurate in reflecting the static CFG in terms of function structure and control flow. However, minor discrepancies in the structuring of blocks and labeling can impact the clarity of its representation of control flow. Addressing these discrepancies by standardizing the inclusion of metadata like line numbers and ensuring consistent labeling of loop constructs may improve overall alignment. Still, given the outlined score, the LLM-generated CFG offers a fairly robust representation of the static CFG."
