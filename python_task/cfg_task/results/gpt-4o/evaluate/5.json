    "Blocks": {
      "comparison": "The blocks in both CFGs are largely similar, with minor differences in block labels and the way some blocks are subdivided. The LLM CFG splits some blocks more granularly, especially in the 'create_state_space_tree' function, where it separates the for-loop and its body into distinct blocks.",

      "differences": {
        "example": "In the 'create_state_space_tree' function, the LLM CFG has a separate block for the for-loop condition and its body, whereas the static CFG combines them into a single block."

    "Edges / Successors": {
      "comparison": "The control-flow edges between blocks are identical in both CFGs. Both correctly represent the branching after if-statements and the flow within loops.",

    "Additional Observations": {
      "comparison": "No significant differences in how special constructs are represented. Line numbers in the LLM CFG provide additional context but do not affect the control flow.",
      "match": true
    }
  },
  "summary": "The LLM-based CFG closely matches the static-based CFG across all analyzed dimensions. The main differences lie in the granularity of block subdivision, which does not impact the overall control flow. The LLM CFG is highly accurate, with a score of 95 out of 100, indicating a very close alignment with the static CFG."
