This means that one queen\ncannot have any other queen on its horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines.\n\nSolution:\n\nTo solve this problem we will use simple math. First we know the queen can move in all\nthe possible ways, we can simplify it in this: vertical, horizontal, diagonal left and\n diagonal right.\n\nWe can visualize it like this:\n\nleft diagonal = \\\nright diagonal = /\n\nOn a chessboard vertical movement could be the rows and horizontal movement could be\nthe columns.\n\nIn programming we can use an array, and in this array each index could be the rows and\neach value in the array could be the column. For example:\n\n    . Q . .     We have this chessboard with one queen in each column and each queen\n    . . . Q     can't attack to each other.\n    Q . . .     The array for this example would look like this: [1, 3, 0, 2]\n    . . Q .\n\nSo if we use an array and we verify that each value in the array is different to each\nother we know that at least the queens can't attack each other in horizontal and\nvertical.\n\nAt this point we have it halfway completed and we will treat the chessboard as a\nCartesian plane.
